title: Bookmarks Dump
author: Daniel Tompkins
description: Exactly what the title says! I'll try to keep this page going with an updated dump of my bookmarks. You can export yours too— the tutorial's screenshots are outdated, but it still gets you to the right place. I used a couple simple Javascript functions to pull in the downloaded JSON file from Firefox, parse through it, and then styled the list with some basic CSS.

## Download your bookmarks

Do you organize bookmarks in Firefox? [Export your bookmarks](https://www.cloudwards.net/how-to-backup-firefox-bookmarks/#:~:text=Open%20Firefox%20and%20press%20Ctrl,open%20the%20bookmark%20library%20window.&text=In%20the%20bookmarks%20library%20menu,select%20your%20preferred%20JSON%20file.) to a `.json` file for safe-keeping!

I'll try to keep this page going with an updated dump of my bookmarks. I used some Javascript to load the downloaded JSON file (from Firefox), parse through it, and then styled the list with some basic CSS. Pretty cool!

Browse through troves of collected resources on the decentralized Web; links to new media art and artists; tons of exciting DIY projects; academic writing on technopolitics, privacy, and surveillance— along with all sorts of other fun goodies. Go buck-wild. ♥
