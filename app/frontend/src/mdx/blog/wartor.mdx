Oddly enough, I don't remember when or how I first got my hands on the [Toshiba <em>FlashAir</em>](https://www.toshiba-memory.com/products/toshiba-wireless-sd-cards-flashair-w-04/) card. These WiFi-enabled SD cards are made to transfer photos from a digital camera to a computer.

Imagining that someone would use a 4MBps wireless connection to transfer photos when the hardware transfer is closer to 70MBps seems ridiculous.

However, it could come in handy if you're in a situation where you don't have access to an SD card reader, or want to easily preview photos on a phone or tablet.

## Digging into the FlashAir

What's far more interesting about these Toshiba cards is the fact that they are essentially programmed to act as a [wireless access point (WAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point). You can setup a custom SSID and passwordâ€” connecting directly to the card over 2.4GHz.

After peeking at the filesystem, I realized that the main photo gallery application hosted on the card is essentially a static websiteâ€” served as basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

My excitement with this bit of tech was the possibility of building a totally discrete microserver that would be capable of hosting a few pages and services.

## Project Inspiration

My fourth-year undergraduate architecture studio, entitled Dark Rooms, was taught by [Mona Mahall](https://m-a-u-s-e-r.net/). The studio was split into three exhibitions: _Pyramid, Server and Backstage_. These exhibitions were meant to explore the "spaces between visibility and invisibility".

In the second exhibition, _Server_, we were asked to consider the design of an anti-human spaceâ€” a dark, cold, electronic archive built exclusively for machines. In my preliminary research, I was particularly interested in artists like [Adam Bartholl](https://arambartholl.com/dead-drops/).

His project, a USB "[dead drop](http://deaddrops.com/)", drew inspiration from an information-sharing tactic used by spies. A predetermined secret locationâ€” such as a hollowed-out rock, brick, log or other objectâ€” would be used to discreetly stash an important item.

Once the itemâ€” perhaps a slip of paper or a keyâ€” is "dropped", a second party could then retrieve it without interacting directly with the other person or being detected in the exchange.

## Wireless Anonymous Repository

While a USB is already a much more "invisible" way of storing and exchanging information, I wanted to take this concept a step further. Using the _FlashAir_ cards, I proposed a new wireless dead drop that could be just as affordable and simple as the USB, but with a myriad of superior qualities.

Writing directly to the card requires an SD card slot; however, the wireless functionality can be powered without a desktop or laptop. A typical SD card takes 2.4-3.6V at about 30mA. I found that by using an SD-to-USB adapter, one could power the wireless module from a standard 5V USB outlet.

Depending on the location of the dead drop, this could be concealed within a false junction box that would be plugged in over the top of a standard 2-outlet 120V AC. Ifâ€” in the spirit of the original USB dead dropâ€” you wanted to embed the card in a brick wall, then the device could be powered from a USB powerbank.

I named the project warTOR for "wireless anonymous repo" + [TOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)). Though it's not connected to the Tor network in any way, I thought this title captured the spirit of anonymity (plus I wanted to use some PokÃ©mon sprites). If someone would like to try it, the Toshiba cards can be setup as a wireless bridge... from a Tor gateway?

## Future Plans

Something else that I'd like to try is powering the card via a small solar cell, but I haven't gotten there yet... The greatest benefit of the wireless dead drop is that one could log into the WAP from their cellphone, upload or download a file, and no one could discern that any sort of exchange was happening. However, I'm also working on a clientside chat application that could be hosted on the cards.

With this implemented, then two people could sit down in a cafÃ© and send messages back and forth over the private network; or, someone could login to the network and type out a message for the other person to see at a later date.

Here are some screenshots from the application ðŸ‘†. I'll be doing a follow-up post with a GitHub link to the _FlashAir_ CONFIG file that I'm using on my card. I'll also upload the source code for the original _warTOR_ server with instructions on how you can deploy your own _warTOR_ in the wild!
