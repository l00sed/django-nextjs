Politics are in season. Theresa May has announced her resignation, and now Boris Johnson is building a ["cabinet for modern Britain"](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-prime-minister-cabinet-ministers-tory-party-a9017916.html) as the next appointed Prime Minister. He's optimistic about building a new Brexit deal, and to _"take advantage of all the opportunities that it can bring."_

Meanwhile in the US of A, the DNC is gearing up for its next set of [debates](/democratic-debates) with the surviving candidates&mdash; those who've managed to achieve the requisite [fundraising quotas](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/14/dnc-fundraising-polling-early-debates-1170182). Bob Mueller is prepping for his public testimony tomorrow with Aaron Zebley, his top aide on the Russia investigation&mdash; much to Trump's disappointment.

To be fair, I have a Bernie sign in my car from when he spoke in Pittsburgh. Bernie mostly emphasized his work in support of unions; however, more recently, he announced his plan to dissolve student debt and make public universities tuition-free.

On his [website](https://berniesanders.com/issues/college-for-all/), Bernie says he will _"Cancel the entire $1.6 trillion in outstanding student debt"_, and I'm totally on board! ðŸ˜€ But how are you going to do it Bernie?? Could he actually achieve student loan forgiveness for an estimated 45 _million_ student borrowers?

On [berniesanders.com](https://berniesanders.com), the self-declared "democratic socialist" lays out his plans:

> To pay for this, we will impose a tax of fraction of a percent on Wall Street speculators who nearly destroyed the economy a decade ago. This Wall Street speculation tax will raise $2.4 trillion over the next ten years. It works by placing a 0.5 percent tax on stock trades&mdash; 50 cents on every $100 of stock&mdash; a 0.1 percent fee on bond trades, and a 0.005 percent fee on derivative trades." in debt?

He's not just talking out his butt! There's a plan! In addition to the info on Sander's website, I also dug up a link to the official "Student Debt Cancellation Act of 2019" on [sanders.senate.gov](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/college-for-all-2019-bill-text?id=EA9FB5FB-F84D-4505-8737-BE0C0B5830B8&download=1&inline=file)&mdash; embedded within the "College for All Act of 2019". I also found an earlier draft of Senator Sanders' bill which was [introduced in 2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/806).

The 2019 version includes "TITLE IV"&mdash; _"Student Debt Cancellation"_. I'll give it a more thorough read&mdash; as should you&mdash; especially if you're a recent graduate with hundreds of thousands in debt (like me). At first glance, it looks like any debt originating from loans disbursed by private lenders would not be forgiven&mdash; only "eligible Federal student loan[s]..."

I'll write back when I learn more! Yep, it's an intense moment in American (and international) politics.
