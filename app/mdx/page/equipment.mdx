## Technologists and their Stuff

When I was a kid, I played _Pong_ a few times on my dad's Commodore 64 and an old Sony CRT. I wasn't nearly as obsessed with electronics and software then, but my current self would be thrilled to revisit the 8-bit computer and the static-y curved glass of that old display.

Today, our personal computers are vastly more diverse and advanced. With smartphones, most people carry a powerful computer in their pockets. If I had oodles of cash, I could buy a video card that has more VRAM than my first computer's hard disk storage!

What's the tech that keeps you running day-to-day? What's your dream setup?
