If you're interested in a decentralized Internet, if you wonder how technology infiltrates politics (for better or worse), or if you're simply itching for a good readâ€” take a look at one of the titles below. You'll find a mix of the pleasurable and the scholarly; but undoubtably something interesting. For my own sake I split the list up into "Reading, To Read, and Read". If you see anything on the list that you recognize, let me know what you thought! If you have a recommendation, drop a line in the comments! Also take a look at my recent [Bookmarks Dump](/bookmarks) for additional reading, tutorials, entertainment, and other content.
