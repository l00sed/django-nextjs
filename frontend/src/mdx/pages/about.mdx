## Whoami

This is Daniel Tompkins&mdash; designing and developing _l-o-o-s-e-d.net_ behind the scenes. I've worked as a designer and fabrication specialist in studios from Chicago to New York City and Pittsburgh. Much of my work draws heavily upon his education in architecture and design, which introduced me to the practice of rigorous visual representation and physical prototyping. I'm an expert in the use of computational design tools that aid in 3D modeling and analysis. I'm also a mostly self-taught programmer, and currently works as a Web developer at the Software Engineering Institute.

In my professional design work, I've used digital simulations and original scripts to aid in the design and fabrication of installation artwork for Fortune 500 companies across the United States. My professional production involvement has been almost exclusively multimedia sculpture and interactive marketing environments.

In 2020, I contributed to the design and fabrication of a 35-foot hanging light sculpture with Pittsburgh-based studio, Iontank. The LED-lit sculpture resides in the recently-completed academic cancer center at Allegheny General Hospital. I built the master 3D-model and played an important role in the fabrication, assembly, staging, and final installation.

After completing a Bachelor degree in architecture from Cornell, I pursued a Master in Design Studies degree at Harvard. There, I continued to build on my knowledge of spatial design, focusing on art and the public domain. Here my tool-set expanded to include working with complex digital datasets and composing interactive visualizations with code. At MIT's Media Lab, I also continued to learn to prototype with electronics and to code.

In my own work, I frequently explore a hybrid digital-physical approach. My [master thesis](/signs-of-life) presented a monument resembling the nose of a rocket that would receive satellite images of Earth (using a hand-made antenna) and project those images onto the ground in front of the sculpture.

Media continues to be central to my research— in particular, I'm interested in how the physical infrastructure and organization of the Internet influences society and politics. I volunteered with Pittsburgh's MetaMesh non-profit to help bring free wireless Internet to under-served communities by assembling a network of antennas. Through my research and designs, I hope to empower intellectuals, technologists, activists, and digital citizens alike to interrogate the possibilities of a digital "architecture" and continues to connect physical and virtual space.

## What is l-o-o-s-e-d?

This site was meant to be an incubator for critical discourse in technology and politics&mdash; _technopolitics_.

Approaching my Master thesis, I began researching the state of the Internet and media in the United States&mdash; in particular, comparing the physical infrastructure, organization, and culture of our American internet to the "street network", or SNET, in Cuba.

"LOOSED" began simply as a platform to present the reading responses assigned in Professor Nicco Mele's class: The Internet and Political Campaigns. Although, I hope it will grow into a much more robust platform for exploring how our life "online" entangles with daily, physical lives.

One of my first professional mentors likened the architect to a conductor, directing a nique ochestra. Some of this site's content (Web development tutorials and electronics projects) might seem unfit for someone who began their academic career in architecture. Architecture arguably meets at the intersection of law, politics, culture, ecology, engineering, technology, art and design.

The architect coordinates the collective efforts of the many respective experts it leases&mdash; all the while, appealing to a client and their needs. The neat set of drawings that they submit is not only a physical documentation of the building and its site, but an implicit description of its function and purpose.

The problem architects face is complex, and in many ways it demands much more than brick and mortar. As architecture and other disciplines become entangled with technology, it's become evident that space is both physical as well as virtual.

This transition is occurring not only in architecture, but across a vast number of professions. The analog networks that once influenced the built environment have morphed with a digital infrastructure.

### Why _loosed_?

For years I'd used "l00sed" as my username for a variety of platforms online— meant to be a play on "lucid". When at one point I was poring over digital music and producers, I imagined it could be my DJ name.

It turned out, however, to be an apt title for this LOOSED project. As the past tense of the verb "loose"&mdash; as in, to release, or free&mdash; "loosed" ironically became a wonderful call-to-action. In these pages, I hope you will find some sense of liberation.[^1]

## Timeline

### 2018-9

- Moved to Pittsburgh with my ~~girlfriend~~ wife!
- Worked as a designer and digital fabricator at Iontank&mdash; a company that produces new media art installations for companies.
- I got to work on some really cool projects in my year-and-a-half there&mdash; including the Academic Cancer Center sculpture, now hanging in the atrium of Allegheny General Hospital's recent addition.
- I did a little volunteering with the folks at MetaMesh. They're a local non-profit that's working to bypass the ISPs by building a free and public network across the Burgh's neighborhoods.

### 2020-1

- Got married!
- I have been working as a Web Developer at Shift Collaborative— websites and marketing for some other incredible (often local) businesses.
- This semester, I'm also getting to teach a talented group of first-year architecture students as an adjunct faculty member at Carnegie Mellon.

### 2022

- Had a baby!
- Started working for the Software Engineering Institute

[^1]:As an additional note, I'd like to thank Alicia Valencia, who designed the loosed logo for our collaborative project Freego— which can be found in my portfolio. It is a mashup of the Statue of Liberty's torch with the Wi-Fi symbol, which is intended to symbolize wireless/online freedom.
